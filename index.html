        <p>Tourism is the activity of traveling to different places for
             leisure, business, or other purposes. It has become a significant global 
             industry with a profound impact on economies, cultures, and the environment. 
             People travel to experience new cultures, enjoy natural landscapes, historic sites, 
             and engage in various activities. Tourism contributes to the economy by generating revenue
              and employment opportunities. It also promotes cultural exchange and understanding between people
               from different backgrounds. However, tourism can bring challenges like over-tourism and cultural commodification.
                To address these issues, sustainable tourism practices are gaining importance. 
                Technology and improved connectivity have revolutionized how people plan and experience travel. 
                Overall, tourism plays a crucial role in promoting global understanding and economic growth,
                 but careful planning and management are essential to ensure its long-term sustainability and 
                 positive impact on host communities.</p>
